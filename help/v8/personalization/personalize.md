# Personalize your content{#add-personalization}

![](../assets/do-not-localize/badge.png)

You can personalize the message content by:

* Inserting dynamic **personalization fields**

    Personalization fields are used for first-level personalization of your messages. You can select any field available in the database from the personalization editor. For a delivery, you can select any field related to the recipient, the message or the delivery. These personalization attributes can be inserted in the subject line or the body of your messages.

    ![](assets/perso-subject-line.png)

    The following syntax inserts the city of the recipient in your content: <%= recipient.location.city %>.
    
* Inserting pre-defined **content blocks**
    
    Campaign comes with a set of personalization blocks which contain a specific rendering that you can insert into your deliveries. For example, you can add a logo, a greeting message, or a link to the mirror page of the message. Content blocks are available from a dedicated entry un the personalization editor.

Once inserted, the content block is added to the email content, as shown below. It is automatically adapted to the recipient profile when personalization is generated, at the delivery preparation step.
