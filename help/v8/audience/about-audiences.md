In this section, learn how to define the audience of email. The audience is the main target of your delivery: the recipients who receive the email. The type of audience depends on the target mapping defined in the delivery template. See this [section](../email/create-email.md). 

To define the audience, you can:

* use an existing audience, see this [section](add-audience.md).
* create a new audience. See this [section](segment-builder.md).

You can also define control groups to avoid sending messages to a portion of your audience in order to measure the impact of your campaigns. See this [section](control-group.md).
