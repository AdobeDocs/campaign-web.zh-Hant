After preparing and sending an email, the delivery logs allow you to verify that there is no error. These logs can be accessed directly from the message dashboard. They show the detail of the sending, which target has been excluded and why, as well as the tracking information such as opens and clicks.

To view the logs, access your delivery dashboard and click the **Logs** button.

Several tabs are available:

## Logs

The **Logs** tab contains all messages relating to the delivery and the proofs. Specific icons allow you to identify errors or warnings. 

All the validation steps, warnings and errors are listed. Colored icons show the message type:

* The grey icon indicates an informative message.
* The yellow icon indicates a non-critical processing error.
* The red icon indicates a critical error that prevents sending the delivery.
