The steps to define the content of your email are as follows:

1. Check the **[!UICONTROL From name]** and **[!UICONTROL From email]** information. These fields are read-only, they are configured in the email template selected when creating the email.

1. Define the email **[!UICONTROL Subject line]**. To do this, type your subject directly into the dedicated field, or open the Expression Editor to define to add personalization using various attributes and content blocks or offers.
